# Doubly-Linked-Lists-Sequential-Lists
At the University of Waterloo, MTE 140 is the Data Structures & Algorithms course for Mechatronics Engineering students.
During my time in the course, I got to learn about Doubly Linked, and Sequential Linked Lists. The code in this repository
is my version of the code used within the course.
